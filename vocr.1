.SH DESCRIPTION
vocr is a simple utility for performing optical character recognition
(OCR) on images and PDFs. It prints any text found in the specified
files to stdout.  vocr relies on, and derives its names from, the
Vision framework (v for [V]ision).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-i [no|tab]
If -i is specified with the 'no' option, vocr will not attempt to indent
any text that is OCR'ed.  If -i is specified with the 'tab' option, vocr
will indent using tabs instead of spaces (by default vocr indents using
spaces).
.TP
.B \-p
When OCR'ing a PDF, tells vocr to insert a page break (^L) at the end
of each page.
.TP
.B \-f
Use the [f]ast algorithm for ocr.  This may be useful when recognizing
text in non-English languages, such as German.
.TP
.B \-l [lang]
If -l is specified, on MacOSX 11.x (BigSur) and newer, vocr will ask the
Vision framework to recognize the text in the specified language.  The
supported language options are: 'de' (German), 'en' (English), 'fr'
(French), 'it' (Italian), 'pt' (Portuguese), 'es' (Spanish), 'zh'
(Chinese).
.TP
.B \-v
Enables verbose mode - vocr will print out informational and/or error
messages.
.SH PLATFORMS
